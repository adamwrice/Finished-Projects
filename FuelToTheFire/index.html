<h1>Fuel To The Fire!</h1>

<p>Fuel To The Fire is a simple survival game I made to learn how to use Unity.</p>

  <p>Here is a video demonstrating gameplay!</p>

  <p>In this game, you play as a man in a drill after a nuclear apocalypse. The Earth has frozen over in a nuclear winter and as the man in the drill, you must find minerals to burn in order to stay warm. Your heat is marked my the thermometer in the UI, which will slowly drop over time. Minerals can be found throughout the environment and can be mined and burned. The current objective of the game is to survive for as long as possible but I will continue to update it to include more mechanics and content.</p>
  <p>There currently is a small bug where the first mineral you mine gives you two, but that will be fixed shortly.</p>
