<h1>No Thanks!(giving)</h1>

<p>No Thanks! (giving) is a simple game I made exploring behavior trees and boid behavior during a course I was taking about game engine design.</p>

  <p>Here is a video demonstrating gameplay!</p>

  <p>In this game, you play as a turkey soon to be served for dinner by a family of identical humans. However, while their backs were turned, you loudly escaped the oven. 
  The objective of the game is intentially left arbitrary. You can either escape in the shortest time by moving the turkey to the arrows or
    you can try to avoid the humans for as long as possible.</p>
    
  <p>The boid flocking behavior is simulated using a custom physics engine and the behavior tree is very simple: just wait until something comes into view, if its another human, follow it.</p>
  
  <p>Currently there is a bug that is keeping an end game message from appearing after the turkey escapes or is captured displaying whether
    the player won or lost as well as their final time. It will be resolved soon. </p>
