    <p>Hi! My name is Adam Rice, and I am a recent graduate of GMU with a B.S. degree in Applied Computer Science with a concentration in Game Design. I am seeking a position
        to expand my knowledge and spread my love for games to others. It has been my dream to develop games since I was a kid. I applied and was accepted into the IT 
        specialty center in high school which focused on programming (Python and Java), project management (Agile and SCRUM), and the system development life cycle. 
        This created a solid foundation of programming knowledge for me to expand on in college. Additionally, my time in college awarded me a broader skill set, so I
        understand the intricate parts of game design. This includes 2D and 3D animation, 3D modeling and rigging, narrative design, in addition to many more programming
        courses (Java/C/C++). Now, with my degree, I am excited to move to the next step of my educational journey, learning the techniques and skills required to make
        quality games firsthand. In the meantime, I am working on my own to create a mod for Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 during my job search.</p>
